									<h2>Wife and Partner</h2>

									<p>I’m a strong believer in the power and importance of family — something I’ve admired since my childhood. Love has a beautiful way of crossing boundaries, and mine certainly did. I’m married to my amazing husband, Engineer Charles Kamau, who comes from Karatina in Central Province, while I’m from Nandi County.</p>
									<p>“See how far I went for love?” 💖</p>

									<h3>How We Met</h3>
									<p>Our journey began in February 2019 at a friend’s party. Charles’ laughter, the spark in his eyes, and his lively, jovial personality immediately drew me in. Being an outgoing and social person myself, I knew I had found someone who could match my energy.</p>

									<h3>The Man I Married</h3>
									<p>Charles is kind, happy, and truly a person whose character is worth emulating. Over the years, he has brought so much joy into my life. We’ve shared unforgettable moments — like the time in Ol Pejeta, Nanyuki, when we were chased by a rhino and almost drowned… in our BMW! 😂 His love for meat often inspires him to cook for us on special occasions (not always, but I’ll take it!). “One thing I deeply cherish is his care and support, especially when I’m unwell.”</p>
									<h3>Our Marriage Journey</h3>
									<p>Marriage is not a bed of roses, but through the years, we’ve faced challenges hand-in-hand, always seeking solutions together. We’ve made it a point to nurture our bond through shared activities:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Celebrating birthdays and anniversaries with special outings.</li>
										<li>Playing games like cards, pool, and darts.</li>
										<li>Watching football together.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>These little traditions have helped us grow stronger.</p>
									<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
									<p>Marriage has taught me: <strong>Patience,</strong> <strong>Tolerance,</strong> <strong>Respect,</strong> and <strong>the value of truly seeing and appreciating each other.</strong></p>
									<p>“You cannot love others fully until you love yourself first.”</p>
									<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
									<p>Together, Charles and I dream of building an empire, raising a happy family, and growing old side by side. “I believe in us — in our love, our friendship, and the beautiful life we are creating.” ❤ This is my love story… complete with laughter, lessons, and a lot of heart.</p>
