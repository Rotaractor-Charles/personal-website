									<h2>🌸 My Journey into Motherhood</h2>

									<p> 
										I still remember the day I held my firstborn, Aryan, in my arms. It was just a year after I had graduated from university. 
										I was still young, fresh out of school, and full of dreams about where life would take me. Motherhood wasn’t something I had 
										fully prepared for — but there I was, a mom at just the start of my adult journey. With Aryan, I quickly realized that patience 
										wasn’t just a nice virtue people talked about. It became my daily lesson. Sleepless nights, endless cries, and those moments of wondering, 
										“Am I really doing this right?” tested me in ways I never imagined. But then Aryan would smile, or fall asleep peacefully in my arms, and 
										I’d remind myself: “The days are long, but the years are short.”
									</p>
									<p>
										Five years later, life surprised me again with another beautiful blessing — my daughter, Nyla. By then, I thought I had motherhood figured 
										out, but she came with her own lessons. Suddenly, I was balancing the needs of a growing boy and a newborn baby girl. Some days I felt stretched 
										thin — trying to give each of them my all while still holding on to myself.
									</p>
									<p>
										It hasn’t always been easy. There were times I felt left behind when I saw friends and peers moving ahead in their careers, while I was 
										navigating diapers, tantrums, and endless laundry. There were days of exhaustion when I just wanted to cry. And then there was the 
										“mom guilt” — that little voice in my head whispering, “Am I doing enough? Am I a good mom?”
									</p>
									<p>
									But in between the chaos, there have been the most beautiful moments. Aryan’s first words, Nyla’s giggles, the way they run to me when 
									they’re happy or sad — those little things remind me that I’m exactly where I need to be.
									</p>
									<p>

									 “Motherhood is the art of showing up, even when you feel like you have nothing left to give.”
									</p>
									<p>
									Motherhood has shaped me in ways nothing else could. It has taught me resilience, patience, and unconditional love. It has shown me 
									that it’s okay not to have everything figured out — as long as I show up with love for my children every single day.
									</p>
									<p>
									I may have started this journey earlier than I planned, but I wouldn’t change it for anything. Aryan and Nyla are my greatest teachers, and with them, 
									I’ve discovered the truest version of myself. 💕

										✨ A Note to Other Moms
									</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									If you’re walking this journey too, please remember: “There’s no way to be a perfect mother, but a million ways to be a good one.”
									</p>
									<p>
									Motherhood isn’t about doing it all, it’s about doing your best with love — and that is always enough. 💖
