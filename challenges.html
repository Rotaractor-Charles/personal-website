									<h2>Life Challenges that shaped me</h2>

									

										<p> Life is a beautiful journey, but it is never without its share of challenges. 
											Sometimes they come silently, testing our strength and patience, while other times 
											they arrive like a storm, shaking everything we thought we had figured out. Looking back, 
											I realize that challenges are not meant to break us — they are designed to shape us, to refine 
											our character, and to remind us of how strong we truly are.</p>

										<p>For me, challenges didn’t come during my early years in school. From primary to university, I enjoyed 
											my studies and embraced every stage. I would even say those were some of the best moments of my life. 
											But life has its seasons, and my real test came later when I decided to pursue my Postgraduate Diploma 
											in Education (PGDE) at the Kenya School of TVET (KSTVET).</p>

										<p>By that time, I was already a wife and a mom. Balancing family responsibilities with academics 
											was a mountain I hadn’t anticipated. On one hand, I had a young child who needed me fully, and on 
											the other, I had schoolwork that demanded focus and discipline. What made it even more challenging was 
											the fact that I had been away from school for nearly five years. Returning to the classroom after such a 
											long break was intimidating, and many times I questioned whether I still had the energy and sharpness to 
											keep up. But one thing I told myself was: I must try. And slowly, I found my rhythm. </p>

										<p>Motherhood itself has been another journey of discovery. I am grateful that I have a supportive husband who
											 has made the transition into parenting easier. Still, nothing quite prepares you for the reality that when 
											 you become a mom, you almost forget yourself. Your child’s needs, happiness, and well-being come first, and 
											 sometimes that means sacrificing your own comfort. Yet, within that sacrifice is a love so deep and fulfilling 
											 that it makes every sleepless night and every worry worth it.</P>

										<p>In the workplace, I cannot say I have faced unbearable struggles, but I have learned that work, too, is a space
											where challenges mold us. I have had to strive hard, adapt to new environments, and learn to appreciate 
											every opportunity that came my way. No job is too small, and every role has taught me something valuable.
											 With each step, I have been reminded of the importance of gratitude, resilience, and continuous growth.</p>

										<p>When I reflect on these experiences, one lesson stands out clearly: life will always test us, but it is in those 
											tests that we find our strength. Challenges are not there to stop us; they are there to push us to grow, 
											to become better versions of ourselves. As a wife, a mom, and a professional, I continue to learn that balance 
											is never perfect, but with determination, faith, and support, it is always possible.</p>

										<p> So, to anyone walking through their own season of challenges — remember this: you are stronger than you think. 
											Do not be afraid of the storms; they might just be the path to your greatest growth.</p>
